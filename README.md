## Task 1 - 🔎 Filtering

Users should be able to filter the table.
They expressed that every column should include an input field where they could type their search.
The table should then be filtered so that only rows that match the search term for the respective column are included.
Your task is to make this possible!

Make sure you start the test runner for the `Table` component.
The test suite includes some essential TODOs to help get started.

## Task 2 - 🗄️ Sorting

Your task is to add a feature that lets the user sort every column of the table.
If you click the column title for the first time it should sort this column in ascending order.
When you click the same title again this should toggle between ascending and descending.

Once again have a look at the test suite for the `Table` component.
